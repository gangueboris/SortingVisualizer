# SortingVisualizer
Welcome to my personal project, the Sorting Visualizer! this project challenged and enhanced my knowledge in various aspects of software development, including sorting algorithms, DOM manipulations, function writing to solve problems, and project management.

Sorting Algorithms: Explore various sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript, visualized to aid understanding and comparison.

DOM Manipulations: Dive into the intricacies of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.

Problem Solving: Develop and implement JavaScript functions to solve common algorithmic problems, enhancing problem-solving skills.

Project Management: Gain insights into project management practices, including planning, development and testing.
