# SortingVisualizer
Welcome to my personal project, the Sorting Visualizer! This project serves as a platform for me to challenge and enhance my knowledge in various aspects of software development, including sorting algorithms, DOM manipulations, function writing to solve problems, and project management.

Sorting Algorithms: Explore various sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript, visualized to aid understanding and comparison.
DOM Manipulations: Dive into the intricacies of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.
Problem Solving: Develop and implement JavaScript functions to solve common algorithmic problems, enhancing problem-solving skills.
Project Management: Gain insights into project management practices, including planning, development and testing.
